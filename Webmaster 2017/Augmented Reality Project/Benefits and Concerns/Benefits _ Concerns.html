		<h1>Benefits</h1>
		<p>•Exploration: Use in automobiles could help with reminders of everyday maintenance, such as oil and tire pressure. It could also provide a range of technical and travel information such as locations of a coffee shop or museum.</p>
		<p>•Commerce: A possibility would the ability to browse a virtual catalog of clothes from your favorite brands, which would help avoid lines. This could also turn parks and airports into shopping destinations, which would cut back on the need for shopping real estate.</p>
		<p>•Culture: Would allow for museums and galleries to have premium content for special visitors, as well as virtual tour guides for specific cities around the world. Another possibility would be 'traveling' right in your backyard, learning about international monuments. </p>
		<p>•Safety and Rescue: Rescue operation first responders will be able to have a detailed overlay of the environment specified. This could greatly help police officers and firefighters navigate spaces they are not familiar with before they arrive at a scene of chaos.</p>

	<div class='consBox'>
	<h1>Concerns</h1>
		<p>•Privacy and Profiling: The use of facia recognition technology, geolocation, and augmented data can lead to security breaches on a person's personal information, such as our schedules and pictures.</p>
		<p>•Advertising: As generally intrusive as advertisements are in today's daily internet experience, augmented reality in internet use opens whole new possibilities for companies to monetize objects and spaces in the physical world.</p>
		<p>•Distractions: Mobile augmented reality would also present the problem of danger through distraction from the environment, such as when driving a car. A possible scenerio could be that you are simultaneously viewing directions, social media, and advertisements. </p>
		<p>•Spam: Deceptive advertising techniques and social engineering already through unsolicited email. How much more deceitful can they become if they take form in augmented reality is a real concern we should take into account.</p>
