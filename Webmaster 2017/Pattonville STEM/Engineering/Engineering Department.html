			<img src="../images/Engineering Courses/Ms.White.jpeg" class="Teacher">
			<h4>Kara White</h4>
			<h5 class="Description"> Works on intrinsically important areas such as design process, research, teamwork, communication methods, global impacts, and technical documentation through problem solving. Students use both mechanical sketches and inventor computer aided drafting. Specific topics include differences between joinery, fasteners, and adhesives, engineering design ethics, isometric and oblique sketches, and the application of geometric concepts. Projects include a model train, a popcorn container, and a puzzle cube.  </h5>

		<h3>Principles of Engineering </h3>
			<img src="../images/Engineering Courses/Ms.Childs.jpeg" class="Teacher">
			<h4>Kaitlin Childs</h4>
			<h5 class="Description"> Exploration of topics such as mechanisms, strength of structures and material, automation, and kinematics are done through engaging and challenging problem solving. Skills used and developed throughout the course include problem solving, research, and design to incorporate in strategies for design process documentation, collaboration, and presentation. Projects include a marble sorter, a hydraulic lift, and a projectile launcher. </h5>

		<h3>Aerospace Engineering</h3>
			<img src="../images/Engineering Courses/Ms.Mathis.jpeg" class="Teacher">
			<h4>Sue Mathis</h4>
			<h5 class="Description"> Constructs knowledge on investigation and research on flight characteristics, aerodynamic design analysis, and environmental impact. Evaluation is given to the systems, launching, guidance, and control procedure of various air and space vehicles. Specific topics include the evolution of flight, the physics of flight, turbine, rocket, and space propulsion, orbital mechanics, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Projects include a balsa wood glider and a model rocket that is launched later in the year. </h5>

		<h3>Digital Electronics</h3>
			<img src="../images/Engineering Courses/Ms.Mathis.jpeg" class="Teacher">
			<h4>Sue Mathis</h4>
			<h5 class="Description"> An essential course for students who wish to specialize in a career involving electrical engineering, electronics, or circuit design. Lessons include circuit theory, circuit simulation, Breadboarding, combinatronial and sequential logic, and microcontrollers. Importance is also given to circuit design tools used in actual products such asl logic gates, integrated circuits, and programmable logic devices. Projects mainly consist of circuit design throughout the whole year. </h5>
