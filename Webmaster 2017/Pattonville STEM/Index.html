		<p class='Paragraph'> Pattonville Engineering Department curriculum consists of four courses, two being foundational and the following two specializing in circuitry or aerodynamics. Classroom is greatly aided by and centered around computer and constructional resources. Emphasis is given to the interactions between mathematical, scientific, and engineering knowledge and how each support one another. Projects include model trains, popcorn makers, balsa wood gliders, and circuit designs.</p>

		<h2 class='Arch'> Architecture </h2>
		<p class='Paragraph' >The Architectural Department is constituted by 5 semesters of classes, with the last two being of a specialized topic. Computer Aided Drafting one and two heavily relies on geometrical design and cover topics such as threads, fasteners, springs, gearing, and three dimensional drawing along with parametric modeling. Architectural Drawing includes theory of design, electrical plans, building methods, and building codes. </p>
