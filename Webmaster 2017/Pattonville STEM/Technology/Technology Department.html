				<img src="../images/Computer Courses/Mr.Simmons.jpeg" class="Teacher">
				<h4>Jeremiah Simmons</h4>
				<h5 class="Description"> As the culmination of knowledge gained from the previous three year-long courses, students work on a year-long project that is unique to each of them. Students start out by working with a client to determine an initial problem, research the problem, prototype a solution, and then propose the solution to the client. After revision, students use the rest of the school year to work on the project. Focus is given to collaboration, communication, and documentation skills. </h5>
